# RoomGenerator

  This is a random room map generator project written in Python, including room generation algorithm and map display function.<br>
A few days ago I saw the design principles of a game I really like: The Binding of Isaac, so I wanted to make a debuffed version as my final project.<br>
When I finished, I feel 'Tears' coming down my cheeks.<br>
Here's the video.<br>

So the main idea I was using is:<br>
1. Four directions with four special types of room.<br>
2. Some functions to implement random room generation in order to prevent them from hugging each other<br>
3. I checked many stuffs online and imitated them.<br><br>
Anyway, the process, it was both torturing and interesting. Please try it out.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to start the program.

2. Enter the map size (integer greater than 5).

3. The program will randomly generate a map and print it out step by step.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependency libraries required

Disclaimer: I was busy playing with my newest SD environment for this weekend, so it took me very long time to set up the environment, leaving not very much time to try some new in this homework.![167F1E1B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0fda2c1-b23a-4665-b101-818a2a48af75)
