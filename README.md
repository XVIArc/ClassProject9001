# RoomGenerator

This is a random room map generator project written in Python, including room generation algorithm and map display function.
A few days ago I saw the design principles of a game I really like: The Binding of Isaac, so I wanted to make a debuffed version as my final project.
When I finished, I feel 'Tears' coming down my cheeks.
Here's the video.

So the main idea I was using is:
1. Four directions with four special types of room.
2. Some functions to implement random room generation in order to prevent them from hugging each other
3. I checked many stuffs online and imitated them.
Anyway, the process, it was both torturing and interesting. Please try it out.

## Usage

1. Run `main.py` to start the program.

2. Enter the map size (integer greater than 5).

3. The program will randomly generate a map and print it out.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- No additional dependency libraries required
